# Mike, a university student, navigates a balanced academic week across 7 days, 
# blending study with leisure (effort block 0) and attending roughly 8 hours of lectures (effort block -1).
# Tasks vary widely, from quick note-taking to intensive coursework, with a task cost mostly between 1-3, 
# though crucial submissions may escalate to 4 or even 5, risking course failure. 
# Despite a diverse task list, Mike tends to miss tasks weekly due to varying priorities and time management challenges.
