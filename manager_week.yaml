# Jordan is a manager overseeing various projects and teams. The role involves longer days with
# fewer periods dedicated to high-focus tasks, interspersed with meetings and administrative duties.
# Jordan's week is characterized by multitasking across numerous short-duration tasks, from team reviews
# to strategic planning, with efforts often extending beyond regular hours. Despite the occasional need
# for deep focus on tasks like forecasting and organizing, the schedule is predominantly filled with
# meetings and manageable tasks, aiming to keep everything and everyone on track.
